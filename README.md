# Music-Recommendation-System---Machine-Learning

This is an Unsupervised Machine Learning Model which was built using Cosine Similarity Rule.

It's an Explainable Recommendation Sytem which can explain the explicit reason for the recomendations provided by itself

It can produce 3 kinds of music recommendations. 
Based on: 
1. Artist, Genre
2. Meta data(melodies, mass beat,....)
3. Both Artist, Genre and song meta data

In that way, this model can produce 3 types of different recommendations.


This Recommendation System helps in getting the suitable Recommendations at our individual Intererst.
